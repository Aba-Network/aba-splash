# Splash!

Splash! is a decentralized network for sharing [offers](https://www.chia.net/offers/) across the [Chia](https://github.com/Chia-Network/chia-blockchain) ecosystem based on [libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/js-libp2p) with DHT peer discovery.

Every connected peer receives all offers broadcasted from other peers. There is no centralized connection, the peers connect to each other and are aware of each other.

## Stable Introducers

Introducers are used to bootstrap the network. They are not required to use the network, but they are useful to get started.
